# Imagine the ATM contains $10 and $5 notes, and refine your function accordingly.
# Eg. withdraw(25) would return [10, 10, 5]
# TIPS
# the 'floor' method rounds a float down. Eg. 2.8.floor # returns 2

def withdraw(amount)
  if amount <= 0 # this deals with some of the situations...
    return false
  end
  # ToDo: figure out this bit
  return []
