# Other Notes

The session will be 1h 10m, and will probably only have a handful of people, with one or two mentors.

## Example overview of 1hr 10m session

0m: Brief intro to problem and workflow.
- Get into pairs. (Should more experienced people be paired with less experienced?)
- First person on keyboard for first 25m, second for next 25m

10m: Start working! Lesser experienced of the pair should be on the keyboard.

35m: Switch - the more experienced of the pair should be on the keyboard.

1h: Wrap up, go over final discussion points as a group.
